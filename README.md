# project
# this code asks the user for their favorite color, and then compares it to my favorite color, which is red. If the user inputted red, it says that is my favorite color too, and anything else, it says awesome, my favorite color is red.
# in addition, I had to submit this project solo because I was not able to make it to lab on Monday to get a partner for this assignment.
